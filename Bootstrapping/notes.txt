to learn about confidence intervals, you need to learn bootstrapping first

there are lots of ways to calculate confidence intervals, bootstrapping is just one of them - but its the easiest to understand


======

bootstrapping 

we take 12 mice and weight them. we did not weight all the mice on earth, only 12

we calculate the sample mean - its not the mean of all the mice on the planet, its just the mean of the mice we sampled

however we can use bootstrapping and the data we have here to determine, what values will be reasonable, for all the mice on the planet

===

now we bootstrap the sample

to bootstrap this sample of 12 weights:
1) randomly select 12 weights from the original sample (duplicates are ok) - this is called sampling with replacement
2) now we calculate the mean of the random sample
3) repeat 1 and 2 until we have calculated a lot of means (>10000) - plot them

===

95% confidence interval

A 95% confidence interval is just an interval that covers 95% of the means
A 99% confidence interval is just an interval that covers 99% of the means

===

Why are they useful?

confidence intervals are statistical tests performed visually

because the interval covers 95% of the means, we know that anything outside of it occurs less than 95% of the time 
 
that is to say the p-value of anything outside the confidence interval is < 005 and then statistically significant

======

example of a visual statistical test

this is the sample mean, its an estimate of the true mean for all mice

what is the p value that the true mean of all mice, not just our sample is < 20?

the 95% confidence interval (calculated using bootstrapping or some formula) tells us which values the true means are likely and which values are unlikely

we can see that the values less than 20 are outside our confidence interval

because the highlighted region is outside the 95% confidence interval, which contains 95% of the means, we know that the probability that the true mean is in this area has to be < 0.05 

thus

the p-value is less than 0.05 - this is unlikely and we say there is a statistically significant difference between true mean and any value less than 20

======

Another example of a visual statistical test

we have a sample of female mice

and a sample of male mice

we have done the bootstrapping on the sample

because the 95% confidence intervals do not overlap, we know that there is a statistically significant difference in the weights of female and male mice.


you know the p-value is less than 0.05 just by looking at this picture!

=====

there is one caveat to that and to illustrate that caveat - the confidence intervals overlap

if the confidence intervals overlap, there is still a chance that the means are statistically significant from each other, so, in this case, you still have to do your t-test

but when they do not overlap, we can rest assured that there is a statistically significant difference between those 2 means
